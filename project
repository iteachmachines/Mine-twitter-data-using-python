#In this project i am going to mine twitter data by using python.
#Twitter is a popular social media website where a user can write short sms like messages called tweets. 

Here is the code i have written to search about positive/negative sentiment about any public figure 

import  tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob
consumer_key=" "     #Copy the access token consumer_key from twitter developer profile..
consumer_secret=" "    #Copy the access token consumer_secret from twitter developer profile..
access_token=" "      #Copy the access token code from twitter developer profile..
access_token_secret="... "   #Copy the access token secret code from twitter developer profile..

auth=tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key,consumer_secret)  #Authorization phase
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

api=tweepy.API(auth)

public_tweets = api.search('....') #Name of the famous personality you want to search.
for tweet in public_tweets:
    print(tweet.text)
    analysis = TextBlob(tweet.text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity>0:
        print("1")
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity==0:
        print("0")
    else:
        print("-1")



# Things i have learnt from this project:

    1.Sentiment analysis-Understanding and extracting feelings from data.
    2.How an API works.
    3.How to use TextBlob for Natural language processing task.
